#  NexiBot: Advanced AI-Driven Chatbot for Organizational Efficiency 
 NexiBot is an AI-powered chatbot built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, designed to enhance communication within large public sector organizations. By leveraging the RAG architecture,  NexiBot combines the power of natural language understanding with real-time information retrieval, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant responses to employee queries. Whether it's questions about HR policies, IT support, or upcoming company events,  NexiBot can efficiently pull from vast internal databases and knowledge bases to provide precise answers. This not only reduces delays and inefficiencies but also allows employees to get the support they need instantly, streamlining operations across the organization.


# Problem Statement: 
**Challenges And Problems:** 

In large public sector organizations, managing employee queries and accessing information on HR
policies, IT support, and company events can be challenging. Traditional methods of handling these
queries often result in delays and inefficiencies. An AI-driven chatbot designed to handle diverse
questions and process documents efficiently can transform internal communication, streamline
information access, and enhance overall organizational efficiency.

# Tech Stack: 
**1. AI and NLP Model:**

**Hugging Face Transformers:**

Used to implement the RAG architecture, combining a pre-trained generative language model (e.g., GPT or BERT) with a retriever model (e.g., Dense Passage Retrieval) for generating relevant responses.

**PyTorch & TensorFlow:**

Deep learning frameworks for model training and inference. 

**2. Backend Infrastructure:**

 **Flask:** Lightweight web framework to build the API endpoints for chatbot services.
 
**3. Data Storage:**

**MongoDB:** Relational databases to store structured data, such as employee details, HR policies, and IT support tickets. 

**4. Frontend Interface:** 

**Html/css/Javascript/React.js:** For building an intuitive and interactive user interface where employees can engage with GailAssist. 


# Reserach And References:

For training the  NexiBot model, we collected a comprehensive dataset of research papers from ResearchGate. These papers, covering topics related to HR policies, IT support, and organizational communication, were used to fine-tune the model, ensuring it could provide accurate and context-specific responses. By leveraging this diverse and high-quality dataset, we enhanced NexiBot ability to retrieve and generate relevant information for employee queries in large organizations.
