For training the NexiBot model, we collected a comprehensive dataset of research papers from ResearchGate. These papers, covering topics related to HR policies, IT support, and organizational communication, were used to fine-tune the model, ensuring it could provide accurate and context-specific responses. By leveraging this diverse and high-quality dataset, we enhanced NexiBot ability to retrieve and generate relevant information for employee queries in large organizations.
